## What I learned

I learned a few lessons building this project. The biggest was pushing this project to production. I was experiencing bugs with the app not deploying and the database not connecting. After hours of trying to debug this I realized I forgot that production apps like railway do not read environment variables! I also learned more on how to style with Bootstrap. I also become a lot more comfortable adding logic in the EJS files to make the site more dynamic. Thanks everyone!
